I need to deploy an enterprise web application to Azure and I'm not sure where to start.

I need:
- A network to host everything
- Web servers that can handle traffic from the internet
- Application servers for the backend logic
- A database to store data
- Secure storage for secrets like passwords
- Storage for application data and logs
- Security to protect each layer

Can you help me create the Azure infrastructure? I want to make sure it's secure and follows best practices.
